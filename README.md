## Description 

This project is to make TO's of esports/fighting games lives easier. Want to repeatedly create a new bracket the auto increments with the correct game? Want to pull results of all your participants so that you can make infographics or create rankings? I am hoping to create a one stop shop for creating brackets in Challonge and can get the info you need with one mouse click rather than a lot of extra work.
